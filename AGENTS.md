# Security Track Overlay (user-owned, dev branch)

This fork adapts the academic-research suite for **security-conference
research** (CPS security, IoT security, AI/ML security). The upstream skill
assumes ML/journal conventions; the rules below override those defaults.

## Default assumption

Unless the user says otherwise, every paper task targets a security venue:
the Big 4 (IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, USENIX Security) or a tier-2 venue from
the tracked list. If a task is explicitly NOT security research, ignore this
overlay and use stock behavior.

## Required reading before paper work

Before planning, outlining, drafting, reviewing, or revising a paper, read
the relevant files from `skills/security-track/references/`:

| Task | Read first |
|---|---|
| Venue choice, submission planning | `big4_venue_profiles.md` + `deadlines_current.md` |
| Writing / outlining / revising | `security_paper_conventions.md` |
| Peer-review simulation | `security_reviewer_personas.md` |
| Ranking / tier questions | `conference_ranking_2025.json` |

## Overrides of stock defaults

- **Citations:** IEEE/ACM numeric style, NOT APA 7.0. Two-column conference
  LaTeX, hard page limits — not journal word counts.
- **Structure:** Intro / Threat Model / Design / Implementation / Eval /
  Discussion / Related Work / Ethics — not IMRaD. A paper without an
  explicit threat-model section is incomplete.
- **Reviewer simulation:** use the five personas in
  `security_reviewer_personas.md` (PC Chair, CPS, IoT/embedded,
  Adversarial-ML, threat-model skeptic). Verdict vocabulary is
  venue-specific (per `major_revision_playbook.md` §1) — S&P: Accept /
  Reject; NDSS: Accept / Minor Revision / Major Revision / Reject; CCS:
  Accept / Minor revision / Reject; USENIX '26+: Accepted / Accepted on
  Shepherd Approval / Rejected. Only NDSS still has a Major Revision.
  Calibrate against the standard rejection anchors in that file.

## Deadlines are never recalled from memory

Quote deadlines ONLY from `skills/security-track/references/deadlines_current.md`.
If its `Fetched` timestamp is older than 7 days, refresh first:
`python3 skills/security-track/scripts/fetch_deadlines.py`. If the fetch fails,
say the calendar is stale — do not fill in dates from model memory.

## Repo conventions (fork hygiene)

- `main` mirrors upstream (ff-only); ALL personal work goes on `dev`.
- Customizations are additive only: the `skills/security-track/` skill + its `plugins/ars-codex/skills/security-track/` mirror (or this file).
  Never edit upstream-owned files — that is what keeps `git sync-upstream`
  conflict-free.

## Review & execution conventions

- **All review output goes to `ars-review/`.** Every `ars-reviewer` / re-review
  round writes its decision + numbered task list, the Phase-0 compliance table,
  the panel reports, and the manuscript snapshot under `ars-review/round-N/`
  next to the manuscript — never only to chat. This keeps re-review
  zero-argument and the review history auditable (see
  `skills/security-track/SKILL.md` § Review Workspace).
- **Local Python runs in `~/.venv`.** When a task needs to run Python locally
  (the review-workspace validator, the knowledge-index / behavior linters,
  `fetch_deadlines.py`, or any review/experiment helper), activate the shared
  `~/.venv` first (`source ~/.venv/bin/activate`) — not system Python or an
  ad-hoc venv. Remote GPU experiments keep their own compute environment.

## Research disposition (standing rule)

- **Aim = novelty + improving existing methods.** Position the work as
  advancing/extending prior work — cited as the baseline to beat and build on,
  never as an exercise in exposing other researchers' faults in their
  published papers.
- **A negative / unmet experimental result is a lead to investigate, never a
  stopping point.** Go deep for the ROOT CAUSE (a bug? a mis-tuned baseline? a
  wrong assumption? a mechanism gap?), fix it and improve — or rigorously
  establish whether the approach is genuinely workable. Do NOT settle with
  "let's just honestly report the negative"; reach that outcome only by
  evidence of unworkability, after the root cause is understood.
- This changes the DISPOSITION, not the integrity rules: numbers still come
  only from the ledger, claims stay calibrated to evidence, success criteria
  stay frozen, no goalpost-moving or cherry-picking
  (`research_integrity_protocol.md`). Dig deeper — never fabricate, never
  p-hack.
