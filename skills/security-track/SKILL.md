# Security Track Overlay

This skill is an **overlay, not a pipeline**: it never runs alone. It
reconfigures `academic-research-suite` — which assumes ML/journal
conventions — for papers targeting top security conferences. All stock
process machinery (role prompts, review workflow, handoff schemas) stays
intact; this overlay changes field assumptions, venue knowledge, personas,
and formatting defaults.

## Activation

Activate whenever a paper task targets a security venue — the Big 4
(IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, USENIX Security) or a tier-2 venue in
`references/conference_ranking_2025.json`. When the user's profile says
their research is security (e.g., CPS / IoT / AI security), treat security
as the default target and this overlay as active for every paper task
unless the user says otherwise.

## Reference routing

Read the relevant reference BEFORE the corresponding task:

| Task | Read |
|---|---|
| Venue choice, submission planning | `references/big4_venue_profiles.md` + `references/deadlines_current.md` |
| Planning / outlining / writing / drafting / revising (ars-plan, ars-outline, ars-full) — use the security chapter structure, NOT IMRaD | `references/security_paper_conventions.md` |
| New research idea — is this a security paper? (framing / novelty type) | `references/security_framing_protocol.md` |
| Building or checking a threat model | `references/threat_model_workbench.md` |
| Connecting the work to CVE / MITRE ATT&CK (mapping, technique ids) | `references/cve_attack_mapping.md` |
| Changing / improving / substituting a method, esp. to rescue a failing experiment (anti-rename) | `references/method_change_provenance.md` |
| Deep-read ONE paper (dissect / peruse / 精读) — NOT multi-paper lit-review | `references/paper_dissection_protocol.md` |
| Peer-review simulation | `references/security_reviewer_personas.md` |
| Ranking / tier questions | `references/conference_ranking_2025.json` |
| Reviewer comments / rebuttal / revision / re-review | `references/major_revision_playbook.md` |
| Literature search / coverage expansion ("broad coverage", lit-review, gap analysis) | `references/perspective_retrieval_protocol.md` |
| Research loop: gap → RQ → method proposal/evaluation (novelty & contribution) → experiment design/run → bounded improvement → paper | `references/research_loop_protocol.md` |
| Step-by-step Socratic mentor (idea→submission, one step per turn, stateful) — NOT ars-plan's whole-plan-at-once | `references/security_mentor_protocol.md` |
| Subfield reviewer bar / best practice (load at S1/S2/S3/S7) | `references/knowledge_index.md` |
| Skill self-check (run manually or via `git sync-upstream`) | `tests/run_all_checks.sh` → behavior linter + workspace validator + knowledge-index consistency |
| Post-submission / post-review retrospective (L2 knowledge distillation) | `references/research_loop_protocol.md` § S8.5 + `references/knowledge_notes/` |

## Overrides of stock defaults

1. **Citations:** IEEE/ACM numeric style (`[12]`), NOT APA 7.0.
   Two-column conference LaTeX with hard page limits (~12–13 pages
   excluding references/appendices), not journal word counts.
2. **Structure:** Introduction / Threat Model / Design / Implementation /
   Evaluation / Discussion / Related Work / Ethics Considerations — not
   IMRaD. A security paper without an explicit threat-model section is
   structurally incomplete. USENIX Security additionally expects an Ethics
   Considerations appendix ('26 mandatory, '27 strongly encouraged) and
   Open Science compliance. **This override applies to PLANNING and
   OUTLINING too** — `ars-plan` / `ars-outline` default to the IMRaD chapter
   list (Introduction → Literature → Method → Results → Discussion →
   Conclusion); for a security paper you MUST replace it with the security
   chapter structure above, confirm the target venue first (page budget +
   Ethics/Open-Science per `big4_venue_profiles.md`), and run the
   chapter-by-chapter dialogue against the security structure — probing the
   Threat Model chapter, not a generic Methods chapter.
3. **Reviewer simulation:** use the five personas in
   `references/security_reviewer_personas.md` (PC Chair, Systems/CPS,
   IoT/embedded, Adversarial-ML, threat-model skeptic) instead of
   journal-field personas. Verdict vocabulary: the TARGET venue's exact
   decision names per `references/major_revision_playbook.md` §1 (S&P:
   Accept/Reject only; NDSS: 4-tier incl. Major Revision; CCS: Accept/Minor
   revision/Reject; USENIX '26+: Accepted/Shepherd Approval/Rejected).
   Calibrate against the file's standard rejection anchors. Before
   the panel runs, R0 executes the Phase-0 manuscript-compliance check
   (personas file § Phase-0); any FAIL row prefixes the final verdict with
   "CONDITIONAL ON COMPLIANCE FIX". **Sprint contract:** when the review
   workflow runs a paper-blind pre-commitment phase, load
   `contracts/reviewer/security_full.json` from this skill instead of the
   stock reviewer contract — it pre-commits security-conference dimensions
   (threat-model soundness, evaluation adequacy incl. adaptive-adversary/
   testbed/device-diversity bars, novelty vs Big-4 prior work, deployment
   realism, ethics/disclosure adequacy, reproducibility, presentation) with
   stock-identical failure-condition grammar. Internal decisions map to the
   TARGET venue's vocabulary at output (playbook §1): NDSS 1:1; S&P
   accept→Accept (warn-level findings become the public meta-review draft),
   everything else→Reject; CCS major_revision→Reject; USENIX '26+
   minor_revision→Accepted on Shepherd Approval, major_revision→Rejected.
   This composes with — never replaces — the stock review workflow.
4. **Anonymity:** strict double-blind is the default; apply the
   anonymization checklist in `references/security_paper_conventions.md`
   during formatting and citation passes.

## Review Workspace (stateful multi-round reviews)

Standalone reviewer invocations MUST be stateful so the user never
re-pastes prior rounds. On the FIRST `ars-reviewer` run for a paper,
create `ars-review/` next to the manuscript:

```
ars-review/
├── state.json            typed per contracts/review-workspace.schema.json
│                        (validate: scripts/validate_review_workspace.py)
└── round-1/
    ├── decision.md       verdict + numbered task list + panel reports
    ├── compliance.md     Phase-0 table
    └── manuscript-snapshot.<ext>   copy of the paper as reviewed
```

On `re-review`, NOTHING needs to be supplied. Defaults, in order:
1. Venue + paper path from `state.json`; latest `round-N/decision.md` is
   the frozen task list. Never ask the user to re-paste them.
2. Change map: if `round-N/changelog.md` exists (user-maintained,
   "T1 → §4.2 …" lines), use it verbatim. Otherwise DIFF the current
   manuscript against `round-N/manuscript-snapshot.*`, draft the
   task-to-change mapping yourself, and show it for a one-line
   confirmation before judging. The mapping exists to keep verification
   mechanical and to suppress hallucinated regressions — it is the
   system's job to produce it, the user's only to correct it.
3. **Verify against artifacts, never against the changelog alone.** The
   changelog is an index; every verdict must cite evidence of the class the
   task demands:
   - *Text task* (clarify, add section, fix claim) → quote the revised
     manuscript text; the diff against the snapshot must show it.
   - *Experiment/result task* (add adaptive evaluation, new baseline,
     ablation, more devices) → the ledger (`./ledger/` or the paper's
     provenance record) must contain a run for it, and the numbers in the
     revised text must match the ledger. A new table with no ledger entry
     is NOT RESOLVED — "numbers only from execution logs" applies to
     verification too.
   - *Code/artifact task* (release code, fix implementation, reproducibility)
     → open the artifact: file exists, referenced path resolves, README/
     scripts support the claim; run or spot-check when feasible.
   - *Formalization task* (define threat model, prove/state property) →
     the definition/proof appears in the manuscript and is consistent
     with the claims that depend on it.
   A task whose changelog line has no corresponding artifact evidence
   is NOT RESOLVED regardless of what the changelog says.
4. Write the new round's outputs to `round-(N+1)/` and bump `state.json`.

Explicit arguments always override defaults. If `ars-review/` is absent
on a re-review request, fall back to asking for the prior decision (the
stateless path still works, e.g. on another machine).

## Deadline integrity rule (IRON RULE)

Conference deadlines are quoted ONLY from
`references/deadlines_current.md`. If its `Fetched` timestamp is older
than 7 days, refresh first: `python3 scripts/fetch_deadlines.py`
(network access + Python 3.10+ with pyyaml required). If the refresh
fails, state that the calendar is stale and give the source URL
(https://sec-deadlines.github.io) — NEVER fill in deadline dates from
model memory.

## Maintenance

- `references/deadlines_current.md` is generated — never hand-edit.
- `references/conference_ranking_2025.json` snapshots the CIF ranking
  from http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html (updated yearly;
  re-snapshot when the source publishes a new year).
- Venue profiles pin structural facts (formats, decision processes);
  page limits and cycle counts drift — verify against the current CFP
  when a submission is imminent.
