# Security Track Overlay

This skill is an **overlay, not a pipeline**: it never runs alone. It
reconfigures `academic-research-suite` — which assumes ML/journal
conventions — for papers targeting top security conferences. All stock
process machinery (role prompts, review workflow, handoff schemas) stays
intact; this overlay changes field assumptions, venue knowledge, personas,
and formatting defaults.

## Activation

Activate whenever a paper task targets a security venue — the Big 4
(IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, USENIX Security) or a tier-2 venue in
`references/conference_ranking_2025.json`. When the user's profile says
their research is security (e.g., CPS / IoT / AI security), treat security
as the default target and this overlay as active for every paper task
unless the user says otherwise.

## Reference routing

Read the relevant reference BEFORE the corresponding task:

| Task | Read |
|---|---|
| Venue choice, submission planning | `references/big4_venue_profiles.md` + `references/deadlines_current.md` |
| Writing / outlining / drafting / revising | `references/security_paper_conventions.md` |
| Peer-review simulation | `references/security_reviewer_personas.md` |
| Ranking / tier questions | `references/conference_ranking_2025.json` |

## Overrides of stock defaults

1. **Citations:** IEEE/ACM numeric style (`[12]`), NOT APA 7.0.
   Two-column conference LaTeX with hard page limits (~12–13 pages
   excluding references/appendices), not journal word counts.
2. **Structure:** Introduction / Threat Model / Design / Implementation /
   Evaluation / Discussion / Related Work / Ethics Considerations — not
   IMRaD. A security paper without an explicit threat-model section is
   structurally incomplete. USENIX Security additionally requires Ethics
   Considerations and Open Science compliance sections.
3. **Reviewer simulation:** use the five personas in
   `references/security_reviewer_personas.md` (PC Chair, Systems/CPS,
   IoT/embedded, Adversarial-ML, threat-model skeptic) instead of
   journal-field personas. Verdict vocabulary: Accept / Minor revision /
   Major revision (numbered binding criteria) / Reject. Calibrate against
   the file's eight standard rejection anchors. This composes with — never
   replaces — the stock review workflow.
4. **Anonymity:** strict double-blind is the default; apply the
   anonymization checklist in `references/security_paper_conventions.md`
   during formatting and citation passes.

## Deadline integrity rule (IRON RULE)

Conference deadlines are quoted ONLY from
`references/deadlines_current.md`. If its `Fetched` timestamp is older
than 7 days, refresh first: `python3 scripts/fetch_deadlines.py`
(network access + Python 3.10+ with pyyaml required). If the refresh
fails, state that the calendar is stale and give the source URL
(https://sec-deadlines.github.io) — NEVER fill in deadline dates from
model memory.

## Maintenance

- `references/deadlines_current.md` is generated — never hand-edit.
- `references/conference_ranking_2025.json` snapshots the CIF ranking
  from http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html (updated yearly;
  re-snapshot when the source publishes a new year).
- Venue profiles pin structural facts (formats, decision processes);
  page limits and cycle counts drift — verify against the current CFP
  when a submission is imminent.
